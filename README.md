# **Atm Refactor Project**
## Task: given starter code and basic framework, add improvements to an atm app using react
---
Improvements added:
- Added confirm popup notifying the user that the requested transaction would overdraw the account.
- Added a minimum of 0 to the number input box to prevent negative numbers from being selected. [^1]
[^1]: Note: it is still possible for a user to manually type a negative number or paste in a negative number. Future improvement is to remove this possibility.
